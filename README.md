# moodle-deploy-beta
Deploy accounts and courses on a beta Moodle platform with :
- The extract of teacher list from the production platform (downloaded csv file generated by a custom report)
- A course model, which will be duplicated for each teacher

All accounts will be generated with an oauth2 authentication with the email of the account of production plaform.
In case of duplicate accounts (with different emails), all accounts will be registred in the same course (unless first and last name are not identical between the accounts)

Don't forget to edit config class on the script.
